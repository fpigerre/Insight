== Insight

Insight is built to be used as a fairly modular, insightful dashboard, that can be reached at the tip of one's fingers.

Insight displays commonly required and passive information, such as News and Investment feeds, as well as CCTV information and web utilities.
Insight is built on Rails 4, and is designed to be run in a production environment.

In order to run Insight from a production environment, it is important to run database migrations in the production environment:

```bash
$ rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
```
